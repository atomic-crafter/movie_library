A simple movie library using tmdb api, you can request it on their website for free
If you want some changes to be made let me know, or create a request.
To get started:
  - Put your api key line 46
  - Put your language line 12
  - Change the movies on DVD.txt , there are just an example
For now, there are three buttons, the "Auto run programm" button add your movies to the database,from DVD.txt .
The "Show Data" one display a table (Treeview using tkinter) of your movies + ids + genres,
it also export everything to a .xlsx file.
The "Search movie name" one: you put the id of the movie, and it will diplay the infos of the movie selected.

The ids are those used on https://www.themoviedb.org/ . You can also claim you API key here
